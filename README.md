# SRGAN_BSD100

Implementation of a Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) designed to enhance low-resolution images to high-resolution images. The network consists of a generator and a discriminator trained using the BSD100 dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) to ensure high-quality image reconstruction.
